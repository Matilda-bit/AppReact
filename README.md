## MemeGenerator

## About the project:

Meme Generator is a single page application with two user inputs for upper and lower text and a Gen button for generating images for user-specified text. That's all!)
This is my first project in React, I did it by studying it myself from a video on YouTube
This web page was created solely for fun and to understand how the React works, therefore it has no value on the market. You can download, watch and tryðŸ˜Š
In this project I used JavaScript with React, the project is very simple with a local database in which links to all pictures are saved. Enjoy!


## How to run Meme Generator project?

READ ME TO KNOW THIS

Open command prompt and go to the folder that you want to put this project â€“ 
Here you need to clone my project from git. 
We have many way to do this â€“ I show you one of them:
In command prompt you run: 
### `git clone https://github.com/Matilda-bit/AppReact.git`
Then you can open the project folder that you clone from the your framework(for example WebStorm or Studio Code)
But to run you need to install npm before, so run please in command prompt: 
### `npm install` or ### `npm install -g npm`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
